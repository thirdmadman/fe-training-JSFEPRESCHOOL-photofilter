## Description
Link for original task: https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/js30/js30-5.md

In this app I have used canvas, so it\'s more about Graphic Editor other than Photo Filter - after each action, image, witch is rendered in page are changed - try to save it. As in real Graphic Editor, you don't have any already loaded images, you have to Import Image to start editing process
Just in fact: in this structure of classes I have "actions history" (class ActionsSequence)

### Requirements has been:
1. Use: JS, HTML, CSS
2. Don't use: frameworks for JS, jQuery, webpack or else
3. User YOUR own original code, make it clean and readable
